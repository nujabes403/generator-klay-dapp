![install](https://github.com/nujabes403/generator-klay-dapp/blob/master/images/2install.gif?raw=true)

### 1) Install yeoman generator  
yeoman generator is generic scaffolding system allowing the creation of any kind of app.  
We'll use it to create a klaytn-based blockchain application.  
\- `$ npm install -g yo`

### 2) Install klay-dapp generator  
\- `$ npm install -g generator-klay-dapp`

### 3) Scaffold it!  
\- `$ mkdir tutorial` - Make an empty folder called 'tutorial'  
\- `$ cd tutorial` - Enter the empty folder  
\- `$ yo klay-dapp` - Scaffold klay-dapp your empty folder.  

Now you can see files are populated to your folder, 'tutorial'.  
Let's see each file in detail.

#### \*Just want to run tutorial app right now?
If you have experience for developing klaytn-based blockchain application before, you could skip following tutorial.  
Just type `$ npm run local`, you can run tutorial app immediately.
